## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

ðŸ’¼ I'm Jayesh Singh, a **Senior Pricing Analyst** at Imperial Brands, solving advanced analytical challenges in an oligopolistic industry where pricing is the biggest determinant of business success. Functioning at a ratio of 80% - Data Science and 20% - Pricing Strategy, I live at the intersection of analytics and business strategy, which helps me look at the world with a balanced and logical lens.

ðŸŽ“ I am bestowed with an MSc in Business Analytics from the University of Warwick, reinforcing my philosophy of business-tech balance.

ðŸŒƒ Besides my day job, I have been involved in **building/founding startups** in the past (_some successful, some becoming educational case studies_), **Venture Capital** (_to experience the other end of the startup world_), and several **freelance projects**.

âš½ When I'm not at my desk, I'm likely on a field kicking a football around or scaling heights on a trekking adventure.

### What can I do for you?

This is a question I love to ask. A firm believer of the 'Pay it forward' philosophy, I actively look for opportunities to contribute and support people wherever I can. Feel free to reach out to me about:

  1. **Analytics**: Facing a challenging decision? Having worked as a Data Analyst & a Data Science Consultant in the past, I have supported executive leadership teams in multiple industries to take reliable decisions based on legacy and open-source data. I am good at data mining, exploration, forecasting, and statistical testing to ensure each solution is bulletproof and trustworthy.
  2. **Data Science**: I specialize in building and fine-tuning predictive models that empower businesses to make data-driven decisions with confidence. I have worked on Regression Analysis, Classification Problems, Time Series Forecasting, Neural Networks, and Ensemble methods to improve model accuracy and robustness.
  3. **Startups**: I have been through the rigmarole of ideation, validation, and execution on many occasions, and I pride myself on my ability to deliver outcomes with scarce resources and uncertain roadmaps.
  4. **Revenue Growth Management/Pricing**: My current role sits in the RGM Center of Excellence where our single purpose is to improve the business' bottom-line by optimising the RGM levers such as Pricing, Promotions, Customer Segmentations, Channels, etc.

I would love to have a chat if you find any of these subjects fascinating!
